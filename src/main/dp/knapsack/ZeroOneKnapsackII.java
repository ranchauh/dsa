/**
 * Problem Description
 * Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
 *
 * Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
 *
 * Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
 *
 * NOTE: You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
 *
 *
 *
 * Problem Constraints
 * 1 <= N <= 500
 *
 * 1 <= C, B[i] <= 106
 *
 * 1 <= A[i] <= 50
 *
 *
 *
 * Input Format
 * First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.
 *
 * Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.
 *
 * Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.
 *
 *
 *
 * Output Format
 * Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example Input
 * Input 1:
 *
 *  A = [6, 10, 12]
 *  B = [10, 20, 30]
 *  C = 50
 * Input 2:
 *
 *  A = [1, 3, 2, 4]
 *  B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
 *  C = 10
 *
 *
 * Example Output
 * Output 1:
 *
 *  22
 * Output 2:
 *
 *  0
 *
 *
 * Example Explanation
 * Explanation 1:
 *
 *  Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 10 + 12 = 22
 * Explanation 2:
 *
 *  Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack therefore answer is 0.

    Since constraints for value k is high (10^6), we will end up creating N*C matrix which will be
