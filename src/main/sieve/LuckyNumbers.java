/**
 * Problem Description
 * A lucky number is a number that has exactly 2 distinct prime divisors.
 *
 * You are given a number A, and you need to determine the count of lucky numbers between the range 1 to A (both inclusive).
 *
 * Problem Constraints
 * 1 <= A <= 50000
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first and only argument is an integer A.
 *
 * Output Format
 * Return an integer i.e the count of lucky numbers between 1 and A, both inclusive.
 *
 * Example Input
 * Input 1:
 *
 *  A = 8
 * Input 2:
 *
 *  A = 12
 *
 *
 * Example Output
 * Output 1:
 *
 *  1
 * Output 2:
 *
 *  3
 *
 *
 * Example Explanation
 * Explanation 1:
 *
 *  Between [1, 8] there is only 1 lucky number i.e 6.
 *  6 has 2 distinct prime factors i.e 2 and 3.
 * Explanation 2:
 *
 *  Between [1, 12] there are 3 lucky number: 6, 10 and 12.

/**
 * Hint:
 *
 * Firstly, create an array, letâ€™s say isprime where isprime[i] denotes true or false if number i is prime or not.
 *
 * Now, for every number in the range [1, A], calculate the number of prime divisors, and if the count of distinct prime factors for a number is 2, increment the answer.
 *
 * This can be easily done in O(N * sqrt(N)).
 *
 * The solution can further be optimised to run in O(N * log(N)). The idea is to use a sieve and in place of marking a number of non-prime
 * in the array, while using sieve, just add 1 to it for each prime you iterate. In the end, you will have the number of prime factors of each
 * number. Then the rest is a cakewalk. There are other kinds of sieves as well that you should check out. These are quite fast in
 * terms of processing.
